The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the initialization and configuration of key components on the microcontroller for educational and practice purposes. The code essentially configures the microcontroller to toggle the state of two pins at regular intervals using Timer/Counter1 interrupts.

    Initialization Section (INIT):
        Sets up the stack pointer.
        Configures PORTB for output, making all its bits outputs.
        Initializes Timer/Counter1 in Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) mode with a 256 prescaler.
        Sets the compare value for a 1-second delay using OCR1A register.
        Enables Timer/Counter1 compare match A interrupt.
        Enables global interrupts.

    Main Loop (MAIN_LOOP):
        Contains an infinite loop (rjmp MAIN_LOOP) where the program continuously does nothing.

    Timer1 Compare A Interrupt Service Routine (TIMER1_COMPARE_A_ISR):
        Toggles the state of PB7 and PB4 bits in PORTB, creating an alternating pattern.
        Returns from the interrupt.
